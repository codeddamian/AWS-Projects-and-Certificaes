AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It's a master image for the creation of virtual servers i.e., EC2 instances in the AWS environment.

They are like templates that are configured with an operating system and other software, which determine the user's operating environment.

AMIs are categorized according to region, operating system, system architecture (32 or 64 bit), launch permissions and whether they are backed by Amazon EBS 
or by the Instance Store.

AMI includes a template for the root volume required for an instance; typical example might contain an operating system, an application server and applications.

A block device mapping ensures that the correct volumes are attached to the launched instance.

Users have the facility of selecting AMI provided by AWS, the user community, or through the AWS Marketplace.

Users can also create their own AMIs and share them within the same region or across regions.
